# Food Traffic Light
You have no clue about food? You want to eat more healthy? But you already don't know how to keep up with your New Year resolutions? Don't worry! We got you ;)

Food Traffic Light is an [webapp](https://stephaniehohenberg.github.io/food-traffic-light/), with which you can find out whether the nutrition of your food is healthy or not. 
According to the [traffic light rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light_rating_system) the content of fat, saturated fats, sugar and salt are rated into a color status: green, orange or red. Green for healthy nutrition and red for unhealthy nutrition.
Easy isn't it? At least less confusing than the percentage table on the food product and there is no need for calculating by yourself. Just grab the product, you would like to eat, read the ingredients table, input some numbers (maximum 5) into the food traffic light app and here you go. You found out, whether the product your holding in your hands is healthy for you. Go with green, stop by red.

Stay tuned. A possible camera feature is coming soon. Then you just need to take a picture of the ingredient table to calculate the food traffic light. Until then you can enjoy food traffic light [here](https://stephaniehohenberg.github.io/food-traffic-light/).
